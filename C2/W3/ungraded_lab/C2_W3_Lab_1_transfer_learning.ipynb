This is called _transfer learning_ and you do this by leveraging the trained layers of an existing model and adding your own layers to fit your application. For example, you can:\n",

As Laurence showed in the exercise, you will use up to `mixed_7` as your base model and add to that. This is because the original last layer might be too specialized in what it has learned so it might not translate well into your application. `mixed_7` on the other hand will be more generalized and you can start with that for your application.
